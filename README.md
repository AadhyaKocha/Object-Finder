# Eye Spy
Eye Spy is an Android app that will help the visually impaired find their things and read small text. Using the Google Vision API, the app can alert the user when a target object has entered the camera frame. Additionally, if the user takes a picture, the app will use machine learning to find text in the image and read it back to the user.  
  
If the user is unsatisfied with the app's automated help system, they can call upon the aid of visually able users. These users will be notified that somebody needs help finding an object or reading text and can then communicate with the person in need to solve their issue, via either a video chat or a simple text response.
